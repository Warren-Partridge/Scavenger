# Scavenger Glasses
Hackathon entry for MakeMIT 2017. Scavenger Glasses are a pair of Raspberry Pi-powered glasses that host a scavenger hunt game which is accessible through a web app. It uses image recognition to detect whether a user has found an item.
Scavenger's back end is written in Python, its front end written in Flask, and its hardware is entirely 3D printed (all the non-technical components are anyway!).
